To run the frontend(Angular) there are two ways to execute.


**Procedure 1:**

1. Open command prompt and go to the directory where Frontend folder is located (i.e: in CMD, type "CD LOCATION/Frontend").

2. Now type "code ." in order to open VSCode.

3. In the internal terminal of the VSCode type "npm run start".

   This will take some time to build the project.

4. Use "http://localhost:4200/" on your local browser to view the project.

**Procedure 2:**

1. Open command prompt and go to the directory where Frontend folder is located (i.e: in CMD, type "CD LOCATION/Frontend").
